# empha_entry

My test task I did when applied for a front-end dev position at EmphaSoft.
This is the only time in my life I used JQuery (if only I tiny bit of it), lol.

The task was to create a little mini-app in the VK infrastructure, that asks the user permission to use their VK account and displays some of their friends on the page.
